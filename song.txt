If I had to I would put myself right beside you
So let me ask you,
Would ya like that? Would ya like that?
And I don't mind If you say
This love is the last time
So now I'll ask,
Do ya like that? Do ya like that?
No
Something's getting in the way
Something's just about to break
I will try to find my place
In the diary of Jane
So, tell me
How it should be?
